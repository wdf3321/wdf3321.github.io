This led me to participate in a six-month professional training program to further my development of technical skills.",
    "p2": "During my training, I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to build responsive web pages. I also gained experience in developing JavaScript interactive functions, integrating API data to create LineBot applications, and utilizing Vue.js along with Node.js and MongoDB databases to independently build a website with both front-end and back-end functions. These experiences have given me a great sense of achievement in problem-solving and technical improvement, and have fostered my aspiration to become a professional and active front-end designer, or even a full-stack engineer.",
